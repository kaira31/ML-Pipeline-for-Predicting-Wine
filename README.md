## Student Performance Predictor

## Project Overview
This project creates a machine learning pipeline to predict student performance based on various educational and personal factors. By analyzing a dataset encompassing diverse attributes from academic records, we aim to identify key predictors of student success and provide actionable insights to educators and policymakers.

## Features
Data Preparation: Utilizes Python's Pandas and NumPy for sophisticated data cleaning and preprocessing.
Predictive Modeling: Employs machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees and SVMs, fine-tuned to predict student outcomes accurately.
Model Evaluation: Achieved significant predictive accuracy, leveraging cross-validation and metrics like F1-score and accuracy.
Experiment Tracking: Incorporates MLflow for managing experiments, ensuring traceability of model iterations.
Deployment: Utilizes Flask for creating a web application to deploy the model, making predictions accessible in real-time.
